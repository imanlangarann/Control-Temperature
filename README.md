# Room Temprature Control

This is a personal project that uses `DS18S20` temprature sensor and controls an SSR relay.

To show the current temprature and settings, I used a 4 digits seven-segment that derives with `TM1637` driver.

And for interacting with user (changing settings), I used a rotarey ancoder.
